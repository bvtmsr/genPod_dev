**Project**

The `Project` component is a React component that renders a project page.

**Props**

The component accepts the following props:

* `params`: An object that contains the project ID.
* `getProject`: A function that fetches the project data.
* `addFlow`: A function that adds a flow to the project.
* `setNodes`: A function that sets the nodes for the project.
* `setEdges`: A function that sets the edges for the project.
* `setActiveProject`: A function that sets the active project.
* `projects`: An array of project objects.

**Component Structure**

The component consists of the following elements:

* A `Protected` component that wraps the entire page.
* A `LayoutWithSideBar` component that renders the layout with a sidebar.
* A `Grid` component that renders a grid container.
* A `Grid.Col` component that renders a grid column.
* A `SideNavbar` component that renders a sidebar navigation menu.
* A `Anchor` component that renders a link to the project page.

**Behavior**

The component handles the following behaviors:

* When the component mounts, it fetches the project data using the `getProject` function.
* When the project data is received, it sets the nodes and edges for the project using the `setNodes` and `setEdges` functions.
* When the active project is changed, it sets the active project using the `setActiveProject` function.

## Example Usage

```tsx
import Project from './Project';

const App = () => {
  const params = {
    projectId: '12345',
  };

  const getProject = async () => {
    // Fetch project data logic here
  };

  const addFlow = () => {
    // Add flow logic here
  };

  const setNodes = () => {
    // Set nodes logic here
  };

  const setEdges = () => {
    // Set edges logic here
  };

  const setActiveProject = () => {
    // Set active project logic here
  };

  const projects = [
    {
      id: '12345',
      name: 'Project 1',
    },
    {
      id: '67890',
      name: 'Project 2',
    },
  ];

  return (
    <Project
      params={params}
      getProject={getProject}
      addFlow={addFlow}
      setNodes={setNodes}
      setEdges={setEdges}
      setActiveProject={setActiveProject}
      projects={projects}
    />
  );
};
```

**Technical Details**

* The `Project` component is a functional component that uses the `React` library.
* The component uses the `Protected` component to wrap the entire page, which provides authentication and authorization functionality.
* The component uses the `LayoutWithSideBar` component to render the layout with a sidebar, which provides a consistent layout throughout the application.
* The component uses the `Grid` and `Grid.Col` components to render a grid container and column, which provides a flexible layout system.
