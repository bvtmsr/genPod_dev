**NavLinksGroupForComingSoon.tsx**

This file contains a React component called `NavLinksGroupForComingSoon`. This component is a variant of the `NavLinksGroup` component, specifically designed for the "Coming Soon" page.

**Props**

The component accepts the following props:

* `icon`: A React component that renders an icon.
* `label`: A string that represents the label of the nav link group.
* `initiallyOpened`: A boolean that indicates whether the nav link group should be initially opened.
* `links`: An array of objects that represent the links in the nav link group. Each object should have a `label` and a `link` property.
* `variant`: An object that represents the variant of the nav link group. This object should have a `type` property that indicates the type of variant.

**Component Structure**

The component consists of the following elements:

* A `Group` component that wraps the entire nav link group.
* A `UnstyledButton` component that serves as the toggle button for the nav link group.
* A `Collapse` component that wraps the links in the nav link group.
* A `Text` component that renders the label of the nav link group.
* A `IconChevronRight` component that renders an arrow icon next to the label.
* A list of `Text` components that render the links in the nav link group.

**Behavior**

When the toggle button is clicked, the `Collapse` component is toggled, showing or hiding the links in the nav link group. When a link is clicked, the `preventDefault` function is called to prevent the default link behavior, and the `navigate` function is called to navigate to the link's destination.
